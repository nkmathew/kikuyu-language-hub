## Meaning of the Proverb

The proverb emphasizes the vital importance of **saving, planning, and preparedness** for future uncertainties.

* **Literal Meaning:** If a person sets aside food or resources, they will have something to sustain themselves during times of scarcity.
* **Figurative Meaning:** The "hunger" (*hũta*) represents any kind of need, hardship, or difficult time. The "savings" (*Wĩĩgĩĩre*) represents any resource—money, food, knowledge, or even goodwill—set aside.

The concluding statement reinforces the universal application of this wisdom:
**"Savings of any kind are good"**
The lesson is to always be frugal and look ahead, as those who are prepared will be protected from destitution.
