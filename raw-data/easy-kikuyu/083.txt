The monosyllable “No” is used to modify words and phrases in Kikuyu. Here are some examples.
No mûhaka – It is a must (without NO, mûhaka is a boundary)
No mûûre - You can get lost
No mîtoka – it is just cars
No kwarî na maûndû – there were still issues
No ûgerie – You may try
No nguo yake yarî ndaihu – but her dress was long
Korwo no ûrîrîkane – If you could remember
No ndîmûteithie – I can help you
Ûria mendaga no kwona nyina wao – they only wanted to see their mother
Learn Kîkûyû - Wîrute Gîkûyû - Jîfunze Kîkuyu
