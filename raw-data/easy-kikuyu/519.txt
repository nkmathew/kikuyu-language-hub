## Meaning of the Proverb

The proverb, "The one who demands mashed food has someone to mash it," is generally used to mean:

* **If you are demanding a well-prepared or special service, it implies you have the means (or the person) to provide it.** The "mashed food" (*mũkĩmo*) symbolizes something that requires effort and care to prepare.
* The final note, "**Bachelors cannot expect well prepared food**," offers a more culturally specific interpretation. In this context, it suggests that a person who is not married (a bachelor) shouldn't demand or expect the kind of lovingly or painstakingly prepared meals that might be provided by a spouse. It's an encouragement for bachelors to be more self-reliant or less demanding in matters of food preparation.
