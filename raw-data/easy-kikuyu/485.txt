## Transcription: Kikuyu Phrase

* **Ũũ - like this.**
* **Ta ũũ - like this**

***

**Note:** Both **Ũũ** and **Ta ũũ** are used in Kikuyu to mean "**like this**," often when pointing to or demonstrating something. The addition of **Ta** (which means "like," "as," or "in the manner of") emphasizes the comparison.
