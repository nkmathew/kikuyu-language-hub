When the suffix GA is added to a word, it indicates continuous tense.

Conokaga – be feeling ashamed (Co – as in Shock)

Conoka – Shame, should be differentiated from Thoni – shyness. Sometimes Kikuyus use the two interchangeably
Ena thoni – he/she is shy; When someone is told that he/she has not “Thoni,” it ceases to mean ‘shy’ and implies Shame.
