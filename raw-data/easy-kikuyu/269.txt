## Grammar Highlights

The example sentence is great for illustrating several key features of Kikuyu (a Bantu language):

1.  **Passive Voice (-wo):** The lesson shows the passive voice ending:
    * ***Oha*** (Tie) $\rightarrow$ ***Ohetwo*** (He has been tied)
    * ***Kũmenyerera*** (To take care) $\rightarrow$ ***Ĩmenyerereirwo*** (It has been cared for)
2.  **Noun Class Agreement:** The word for donkey, **Ndigiri**, uses the demonstrative **ĩno** (this) and the subject prefix **ĩ-** (it), indicating it belongs to the $\text{I-I}$ noun class.
3.  **Reflexive Verb (-i-):** The phrase **Wimenyerere** ("Take care of yourself") uses the infix **-i-** placed before the verb root to show the action is directed back at the subject ("yourself").
