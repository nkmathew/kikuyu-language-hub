## Meaning of the Proverb

The proverb contrasts an obvious physical disability with a hidden emotional or psychological one.

* **Mũthua Kũgũrũ** (Lame leg) is easy to see; you know immediately when someone is limping and can see their struggle.
* **Mũthua Ngoro** (Lame heart) refers to a person with an **"ill mind"**, bad intentions, or a troubled spirit. This is hidden from view.

The central message, summarized by the note at the bottom, is:
**"It is not easy to know one with ill mind"**

It means that physical faults are obvious, but a person's inner moral or mental state is concealed, making the latter more difficult to identify and potentially more dangerous or problematic.
