## Meaning of the Proverb

This proverb is the equivalent of the English saying, **"Bend the tree while it is young"** or **"Strike while the iron is hot."**

It means that:

1.  **Correction and Discipline are Best Done Early:** It is much easier to train, discipline, or correct a child's bad behavior (*sapling*) than to try to change the habits of an adult (*fully grown tree*).
2.  **Early Intervention is Crucial:** Good character and habits must be instilled when a person is young and malleable.

The moral lesson provided at the bottom reinforces this meaning:
**"Do not wait till your kids are adults..."** (to teach them or correct them).
