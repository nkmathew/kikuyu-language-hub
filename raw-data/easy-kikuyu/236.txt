Dahl's Law Explanation
Dahl's Law is a historical sound change (a dissimilation rule) that is phonologically active in Kĩkũyũ:

Rule: When the prefix syllable contains the consonant K (e.g., kũ- from the infinitive prefix), and the immediately following syllable of the verb root begins with one of the consonants c, t, ch, or k, the k in the initial prefix changes to g.

Effect: This change prevents two voiceless stops (like k and t) from occurring too close together, resulting in a voiced stop (g).

Note: The vowels that come between the prefix and the root consonants do not stop this rule from applying.

Example in the Table:
You can see Dahl's Law at work in the 1st Person Plural Future Tense:

For verbs starting with the root consonants r, ũ, a (like -rĩa, -ũka, -aria), the prefix is tũkũ- (or tũgũ- for vowel-initial roots).

For verbs whose roots effectively begin with k or t (such as -kena and -theka), the prefix changes to tũgũ- to avoid the double voiceless stop sound:

tũkũ- + -kena → tũgũ-kena (We will be happy)

tũkũ- + -theka → tũgũ-theka (We will laugh)
