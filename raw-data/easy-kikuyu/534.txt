**Summary of the Advice:**
The Warthog advises the sick animal (likely the Zebra from the previous segment) that its illness doesn't require medicine, but rather a set of strict recovery instructions:
1.  Rest peacefully at night.
2.  Be the **first to eat grass** and the **first to drink water** at the pond in the morning.
3.  The cure is also contingent on **cooperation** from all the other animals.
