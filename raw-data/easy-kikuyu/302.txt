**Ũtuko nyamũ ciothe**
**At night all the animals**

**ciakirĩte ki** - they were very quiet

**Ndundu citietanaga**
**The Owls were not calling**

**Ngiria itiagambaga**
**The crickets were not making sounds.**

**Nyoka itiahuhaga mĩrũri**
**The snakes were not whistling**

**Ona Hiti nĩyaririkanire atĩ**
**Even hyena remembered that**
