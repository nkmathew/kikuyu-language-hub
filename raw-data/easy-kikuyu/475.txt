### Kinship Notes

The image highlights a common feature in many African cultures where kinship terms are broader than in English:

* **Tata** is a term for **aunt** and generally refers to your mother's or father's sister.
* **Mama** is a term for **uncle** and generally refers to your mother's brother.
* Your father's brother is also considered a **father** (**Baba**), and their age relative to your biological father determines a modifier:
    * **Baba mũkũrũ** (Big father) is your father's older brother.
    * **Baba mũnini** (Small father) is your father's younger brother.

This system emphasizes the collective responsibility and close ties within the extended family.
