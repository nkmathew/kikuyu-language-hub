### Conjugation Rules Overview

The pattern for the present progressive tense is:

| Person | Subject Prefix | Example (to come) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1st Singular (I)** | **ndĩ-** | **ndĩroka** |
| **2nd Singular (You)** | **ũ-** | **ũroka** |
| **1st Plural (We)** | **tũ-** | **tũroka** |
| **2nd Plural (You pl.)** | **mũ-** | **mũroka** |

*Note: The **-ra-** progressive marker seen in the previous image is simplified here to **-r-** or omitted, which is common in the rapid speech and progressive forms of some Gĩkũyũ verbs. The verbs here use the stem **-roka** instead of **-raroka**.*
