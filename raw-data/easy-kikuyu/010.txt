**Note:** The image contains the Arabic text, the English translation, and a Kikuyu translation (the numbered points 1-7 in the bottom section) of the first seven verses of the Quran, **Surah Al-Fatiha**. I have combined the two numbered lists (English and Kikuyu) to align them with the verses. The first Arabic line which corresponds to the Bismillah (In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful) is typically counted as a separate verse or is understood as the opening. The image aligns the first Kikuyu line with a number 1 and the first English line with a number 2. The code block attempts to transcribe all visible text as it appears in the image.
