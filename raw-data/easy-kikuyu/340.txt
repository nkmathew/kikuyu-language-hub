### Forming Plural Commands

The image explains how to form the plural imperative (telling *more than one person* to do something) in Kikuyu:

**To tell more than one person to do something, simply add letter 'i' to the verb.**

* **Rĩa + i = Rĩai** (Eat! - plural)
* **Ũka + i = Ũkai** (Come! - plural)

### Example Verbs

* **Rĩa** — eat (Singular command: *Rĩa!*)
* **Thii** — go (Singular command: *Thii!*)
* **Koma** — Sleep (Singular command: *Koma!*)
* **Andĩka** — write (Singular command: *Andĩka!*)
