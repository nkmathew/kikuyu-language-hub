### Key Tense Marker

In the recent past tense, the infinitive prefix **Kũ-** or **Gũ-** is replaced by a tense marker attached directly to the subject prefix:

* For example, in sentence 1, the subject prefix for the plural noun *Atumia* (women) is **Ma-**, which combines with the tense marker to form **Mo-** before the verb root **-iga** (**M-o-iga**).
* In sentence 7, the subject prefix for *We* (we) is **Tw-**, which is followed directly by the verb root **-ina** (**Twaina**).
