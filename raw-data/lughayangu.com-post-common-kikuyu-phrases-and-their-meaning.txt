Common Kikuyu phrases and their meaning
Language Greetings Directions Love Language Basic Conversations

This is a basic introduction to short common phrases used in the Kikuyu language that someone will encounter or use at any other time or hear being used. The translation is in the simplest form and grammatically correct, enabling anyone yearning to learn Kikuyu to find it very easy.

Note: 

The Kikuyu language, unlike English, doesn’t have gender-defining pronouns such as she or he. Instead, it only identifies the first, second, and third person within a verb.

Níndoka/ ndoka – I have come (first person singular)

Nítuoka/tuoka – we have come (first person plural)

Níwoka – you have come (second person singular)

Nímwoka - you have come (second person plural)

Níoka/oka – he/she has come (third-person singular)

Nímoka/Moka – they have come (third person plural)

In this example, oka is the verb's root, and then on it are person identifiers in either plural or singular. Ní is for emphasis mostly, and many times in spoken form, it is omitted

Having put that emphasis, it is now easy to follow the given short statements and be able to know exactly the meaning. It’s fun and easy to learn.

It’s also good to understand the sounds of the vowels used in Kikuyu.

-        a =>like in arm

-        e => like in egg

-        i => like in in

-        o => like in opposite

-        u => like in ululation

-        í =>like in it

-        ú =>like in own/oat/oak/oath/

Practising the sounds beforehand will make learning easy. The two extra vowels are just i and u with apostrophes to indicate the sound difference.
